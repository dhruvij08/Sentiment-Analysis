# Sentiment Analysis  

Description - Sentiment analysis is the act of analysing words to determine sentiments and opinions that may be positive or negative in polarity.In this data science project, I have used Python to build a model that can analyse sentiments from tweets - positive, negative and neutral. The dataset assumes that any tweet with positive emoticons, like :), were positive, and tweets with negative emoticons, like :(, were negative.
